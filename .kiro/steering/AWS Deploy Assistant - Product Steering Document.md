   # AWS Deploy Assistant - Product Steering Document

## Project Overview

**App Name:** AWS Deploy Assistant  
**Category:** Productivity & Developer Tools  
**Hackathon:** Code with Kiro  
**Target:** Developers who want to deploy to AWS without DevOps expertise

## Problem Statement

Most developers struggle with AWS deployment because:
- Complex service landscape (200+ AWS services)
- No clear guidance on service selection
- Missing architecture visualization
- Lack of step-by-step deployment guides
- Uncertain cost implications
- DevOps knowledge barrier

## Solution Vision

Create an intelligent AWS deployment assistant that acts as a personal DevOps engineer, providing:
1. **Smart Code Analysis** - Automatically detect application patterns and requirements
2. **Intelligent Service Recommendations** - Map app needs to optimal AWS services
3. **Visual Architecture Design** - Interactive diagrams showing recommended infrastructure
4. **Guided Deployment** - Step-by-step instructions with copy-paste commands
5. **Cost Transparency** - Real-time cost estimation and optimization suggestions

## Target Users

**Primary:** Full-stack developers (2-5 years experience)
- Building MVPs, side projects, client applications
- Familiar with coding but limited AWS/DevOps experience
- Need production-ready deployments quickly

**Secondary:** Technical leads evaluating deployment options
- Want quick architecture assessments
- Need cost estimates for project planning

## Core Value Propositions

1. **Zero DevOps Experience Required** - Deploy complex apps without infrastructure knowledge
2. **Cost-Optimal Recommendations** - Avoid overengineering and surprise bills
3. **Production-Ready Architecture** - Follow AWS best practices automatically
4. **Time Savings** - Hours of research compressed into minutes
5. **Visual Understanding** - See your infrastructure before building it

## Success Metrics

**For Hackathon:**
- Functional MVP demonstrating core workflow
- Support for 3+ application patterns
- Interactive architecture diagrams
- Generated deployment guides
- Impressed judges with Kiro workflow demonstration

**Post-Hackathon:**
- User adoption rate
- Successful deployment completion rate
- Cost estimation accuracy
- User satisfaction scores

## MVP Feature Set

### Must-Have (Hackathon Demo)
- [ ] Code analysis for React, Node.js, Python patterns
- [ ] AWS service recommendation engine
- [ ] Interactive architecture diagrams with React Flow
- [ ] Basic deployment guide generation
- [ ] Cost estimation calculator
- [ ] Modern, bold UI design

### Nice-to-Have (If Time Permits)
- [ ] Terraform template generation
- [ ] Docker configuration detection
- [ ] Database schema analysis
- [ ] Security checklist
- [ ] Multiple architecture alternatives

### Future Roadmap
- [ ] Real AWS integration for deployment
- [ ] Community-contributed patterns
- [ ] Advanced cost optimization
- [ ] Multi-cloud support
- [ ] Team collaboration features

## Technical Constraints

**Kiro Platform Limitations:**
- Frontend only (React + available libraries)
- No backend/database integration
- Limited to browser-based analysis
- Pattern matching vs. real AI

**Hackathon Constraints:**
- 48-72 hour development window
- Solo development effort
- Demo must show Kiro workflow benefits

## Competitive Analysis

**Existing Solutions:**
- AWS Well-Architected Tool (too complex)
- Serverless Framework (specific to serverless)
- CDK (requires infrastructure knowledge)
- Manual AWS documentation (overwhelming)

**Our Advantage:**
- Beginner-friendly approach
- Visual-first design
- Opinionated recommendations
- All-in-one solution

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk:**
- Pattern matching accuracy
- Cost estimation precision
- User interface complexity

**Medium Risk:**
- Scope creep during development
- Demo preparation time
- AWS service knowledge completeness

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Start with proven patterns (React SPA, Node.js API)
- Use conservative cost estimates
- Focus on core workflow first

## Design Principles

1. **Simplicity First** - Complex infrastructure made simple
2. **Visual Communication** - Diagrams over text explanations
3. **Opinionated Guidance** - Recommend the best path, not all paths
4. **Copy-Paste Ready** - All commands should be immediately usable
5. **Cost Conscious** - Always show pricing implications
6. **Modern Aesthetics** - Bold, engaging developer-focused UI

## Go-to-Market Strategy

**Hackathon Demo Flow:**
1. Show Kiro spec-driven development process
2. Demo code upload → analysis → recommendations
3. Interactive architecture diagram exploration
4. Generate and walk through deployment guide
5. Highlight development speed with Kiro

**Post-Hackathon:**
1. Open source on GitHub
2. Developer community outreach
3. Integration with popular development tools
4. Potential AWS partnership discussions

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed technical steering document
2. Design component architecture
3. Implement pattern matching engine
4. Build core UI components
5. Create comprehensive specs for each feature
6. Set up Kiro hooks for continuous improvement
